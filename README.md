# onyx-twitter-sample
Example of an Onyx application using the live twitter stream. This is under active development currently as we move away from `docker-compose` towards [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/). 

Assuming you have Kubernetes 1.3+ and a configured dynamic volume provisioner then the provided manfiest files will run. Documentation will become availible as things finalize.
